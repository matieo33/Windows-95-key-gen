# Windows-95-key-gen
A OEM key generator for Windows 95. It makes a TXT file in which it writes the amount of keys you wish.
BIG NOTE: Half of the OEM keys don't work, and I'm too lazy to find out why. I worked on this a month ago or so and I don't bother changing anything in it. Also the code isn't the best in my opinion.
